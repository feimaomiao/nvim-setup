# nvim-setup 

### Introduction

* nvim-setup is my personal fork of [kickstart](https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim), which includes some rewrites and some other custom packages   


### Installation

* Backup your previous configuration (if any exists)

### Archive Installation
* On the home/landing page for the project find the blue "<> CODE" button click it and select Local > Download ZIP.
* Extract the archive to:
  `~/.config/nvim` (Linux)
  `~/.config/nvim` (MacOS)
  `%userprofile%\AppData\Local\nvim-data\` (Windows)
* Ensure your extraction method did not extract with a parent folder. For example in ~/.config/nvim you should have init.lua not another folder called kickstart.nvim.

### GIT Clone Installation
* From a terminal cd/dir to:
    `~/.config/nvim` (Linux)
    `~/.config/nvim` (MacOS)
    `%userprofile%\AppData\Local\nvim-data\` (Windows)

* run: `git clone https://github.com/feimaomiao/nvim-setup.git ~/.config/nvim` 
* Run neovim (from terminal or shortcut) and allow the kickstart process to download files and set up the basics.
* Once the setup is complete restart Neovim.
* **You're ready to go!**
